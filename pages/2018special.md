This special meeting is being held to address several recent vacancies is the leadership team and will be held similar to an annual meeting.

### Voting

Voting is open to all voting members and you do not need to be present at the annual meeting to vote.

Any member may declare themselves a voting member by meeting the voting member requirements as laid out in our [Bylaws](https://thelab.ms/makers/Bylaws.html).  
Voting member requirements include among other things showing proof of identification via a goverment issued photo ID, valid contact information, and an agreement to have membership details be disclosed as required by law.

In order to declare yourself a voting member contact [vote@thelab.ms](mailto:vote@thelab.ms).

#### Proxy Voting

Voting will take place at the lab space via and electronic ballot (link to be provided to members at the meeting).  If a voting member wishes to vote but cannot attend the meeting in person they can vote by proxy.
This will require an email be sent to [secretary@thelab.ms](mailto:secretary@thalab.ms) to declare your intention to vote by proxy, state which issues/positions you intend to vote on by proxy, and state how you intend to vote on each issue/position.    

[A Proxy Vote Email Form can be found at the bottom of this page.](#ProxyEmailForm)

### Current State of Leadership Team

Most of the current leadership team have resigned thier positions with two exceptions: Tommy Falgout as Floating Board Member (he was the last remaining board member), and James Ford as Facilities Coordinator.  These two positions will continue to be filled as normal until the end of thier normal term in June.

These resignations caused a bit of a crisis as our Bylaws could no longer provide for a way to fill the vacancies.  Fortunatley State Law has a provision for filling board vacancies in the event that Bylaws do no provide for this.  Using this provision Tommy Falgout, as the last remaining board member, made some temporary board appointments to allow for a special election to fill the vacancies per our Bylaws.  These temporary appointments will expire after this upcoming election.

Here is the current leadership team including these special appointments:

* President - Greg Miller (expires 2/10)
* Vice President: Olivia Snyder (expires 2/10)
* Secretary: Richard Gowen (expires 2/10)
* Floating Board Member: Paul Ingendorf (expires 2/10)
* Floating Board Member: Tommy Falgout
* Facilities Coordinator - James Ford
* Chief Technology Officer - WhiskeyNeon
* Education Coordinator - Vacant
* Treasurer - Vacant
* Fundraising Coordinator - Vacant
* Cheif Legal Officer - Vacant

### Election of Leadership Team

#### Election of Officers

Members can proclaim thier intention to run for or nominate someone (who would need to accept this nomination) to run for one or more leadership positions.
Members can run for more than one officer position but may only be elected to one.  
NOTE: A member may hold BOTH an officer position and a director position at the same time providing they can commit to the duties of both roles.

#### Election of the Board of Directors

### Other Business Issues

Here is the current list of the other business issues that have been proposed for a vote.
This list will be updated as new information is submitted.

* To remove the current Chief Technology Officer for abandoning his responsibilities.
    * To conditionally elect a replacement Chief Technology Officer.
* To add a supplimental rule that states If someone's going to hold two leadership positions, then they should be elected to both those positions in the same election.
    * Note that a supplimental rule is not the same as a Bylaw and does not require submission to the State/Fed the way a Bylaw change would.
    * Note that even if this is successfully voted in, this would not effect this current special election
