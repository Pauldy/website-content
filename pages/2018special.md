Special Membership Meeting 2018 and Vote Information

The annual meeting in June is where our voting membership gets to elect our leadership, make changes to the bylaws, and raise issues for discussion.
This special meeting is being held to address several recent vacancies is the leadership team and will be held similar to an annual meeting.

### Date and Time and Location

### Agenda

-   Review leadership positions and current nominees; Solicit additional nominations
-   Review any proposed Bylaws changes
-   Review any other buisness to be brought to a vote

### Voting

Voting is open to all voting members and you do not need to be present at the annual meeting to vote.

Any member may declare themselves a voting member by meeting the voting member requirements as laid out in our [Bylaws](https://thelab.ms/makers/Bylaws.html).  
Voting member requirements include among other things showing proof of identification via a goverment issued photo ID, valid contact information, and an agreement to have membership details be disclosed as required by law.

In order to declare yourself a voting member contact [vote@thelab.ms](mailto:vote@thelab.ms).

#### Proxy Voting

Voting will take place at the lab space via an electronic ballot (link to be provided to members at the meeting).  If a voting member wishes to vote but cannot attend the meeting in person they can vote by proxy.
This will require an email be sent to [secretary@thelab.ms](mailto:secretary@thelab.ms) to declare your intention to vote by proxy, state which issues/positions you intend to vote on by proxy, and state how you intend to vote on each issue/position.    

[A Proxy Vote Email Form can be found at the bottom of this page.](#ProxyEmailForm)

### Current State of Leadership Team

Most of the current leadership team have resigned thier positions with two exceptions: Tommy Falgout as Floating Board Member (he was the last remaining board member), and James Ford as Facilities Coordinator.  These two positions will continue to be filled as normal until the end of thier normal term in June.

These resignations caused a bit of a crisis as our Bylaws could no longer provide for a way to fill the vacancies.  Fortunatley State Law has a provision for filling board vacancies in the event that Bylaws do no provide for this.  Using this provision Tommy Falgout, as the last remaining board member, made some temporary board appointments to allow for a special election to fill the vacancies per our Bylaws.  These temporary appointments will expire after this upcoming election.

Here is the current leadership team including these special appointments:

* President - Greg Miller (expires 2/10)
* Vice President: Olivia Snyder (expires 2/10)
* Secretary: Richard Gowen (expires 2/10)
* Floating Board Member: Paul Ingendorf (expires 2/10)
* Floating Board Member: Tommy Falgout
* Facilities Coordinator - James Ford
* Chief Technology Officer - WhiskeyNeon
* Education Coordinator - Vacant
* Treasurer - Vacant
* Fundraising Coordinator - Vacant
* Cheif Legal Officer - Vacant

### Other Business Issues

Here is the current list of the other business issues that have been proposed for a vote.
This list will be updated as new information is submitted.

* To remove the current Chief Technology Officer for abandoning his responsibilities.
    * To conditionally elect a replacement Chief Technology Officer.
* To add a supplemental rule that states If someone's going to hold two leadership positions, then they should be elected to both those positions in the same election.
    * Note that a supplemental rule is not the same as a Bylaw and does not require submission to the State/Fed the way a Bylaw change would.
    * Note that even if this is successfully voted in, this would not effect this current special election

>
>What James feels is his most valuable contribution to thelab is the introduction and onboarding of new members and training them in the use of our equipment. 
>
>James has demonstrated his committment to the space as our Facilities Coordinator, organizing multiple improvment projects including upgrading the lighting throughout the space and aquiring matching chairs for our classroom as well as overseeing the day to day operations, security and cleanliness of the space. 
>

Olivia Snyder - "olisny" - Nominee for Vice President and Education Coordinator

>Who are you?
>
>I’m Olivia. I am a self-described jack-of-all-trades as I have my hands in a little bit of everything. I’ve was a freelance graphic designer and web designer for 15+ years, I ran my own face painting business for 10 years, and I managed a paint-your-own pottery shop for almost 5. During that time, I worked with various non-profit organizations, from working with folks at special abilities camps to stuffing envelopes to giving historical tours.
>
>What do you do?
>Currently, I focus my efforts on my pottery and art. I run my pottery and art shop, Faerie Hive; the Lab is the sole beneficiary of any volunteer efforts and philanthropy I can offer. What attracts me to the Lab is the enormous potential for utilizing a lot of the tech-based making tools to empower everyone to create amazing things, not to mention the vast pool of expertise in various fields each member brings to collaborations. I love the Lab and love to help people learn new things!
>
>Why should I vote for you? 
>I’ve both learned how to delegate AND how to say no. It is my desire to both organize and promote the Lab in a manner it so deserves. As vice president, I intend to up our presence locally, by forming relationships with the city, relevant local entities, and the public at large. The Lab is only as strong as the members. My skill set and experience in producing visual paraphernalia as well as friendly public relations is more than apropos in helping the Lab find reach members and grow into a strong, stable entity.


Ryan Elliott - "crazybeard" - Nominee for Secretary and Treasurer

>Hi Ryan Elliott here. Many of you know me as crazybeard, and let me tell you my beard is in fact crazy. The other day it jumped off of my face, jumped over 7 burning cars on a motorcycle, and came home after the sun came up smelling like alcohol and indecency. It's also been known to pick up and curl a 300lb barbell, arm wrestle with bears, chop down trees, and one time it freed Norway from a giant troll.
>
>The beard has recently decided that it wants to run for a leadership position of the lab, presumably because it can no longer stand idly by and watch small girly men get scared of some numbers on a page. If elected the beard intends to roundhouse kick the problems to the curb just like Chuck Norris. 
>
>Help the beard to help the lab. A vote Ryan Elliott is a vote for the crazybeard. 


Greg Miller - "GeekPatrolMiller" - Nominee for President

>Greg is a wisened, grizzled member of many positions of authority, elected and otherwise.  
>
>Greg once personally wrestled an armed drone and saved his fellow TheLab members from it's voracious blades of doom.
>
>Greg doesn't need your help in gathering batteries.  
>
>Vote for Greg


Pavel Shatokhin - "this_many_pavels" - Nominee for Vice President and Secretary

>My name is Pavel, I'm a game developer, I'm interested in electronics and robotics, and I have been a member of the lab for almost two years. You may know me as that guy who teaches Blender every other Tuesday, and I have volunteered and participated in many of the lab's events. If you have been here in the evening you've probably met me as I am here nearly every day after work working on projects.
>
>I am running for Vice President/Secretary to ensure that everyone has a place at the lab regardless of one's interests and background. The lab has been a home away from home for me, and I hope to make it the same for you. As a board member I will work with The Lab's Leadership to make sure that everyone can continue to pursue their hobbies in a safe and welcoming environment while expanding the variety of activities that the lab offers. I want to help bring in more equipment, more classes, and more events to build The Lab's capabilities, community, and membership. I also want to foster better communication between membership and leadership and make sure your concerns and ideas are heard. Vote Pavel 2018.
>
>TL;DR
>
>1) Keep the doors open, the lights on.
>2) Utilize our space to the maximum.
>3) Expand  equipment, activities, and events lab offers.
>4) Get everyone to get along.


Brian Mork - "Hermit" - Nominee for CTO

>Who I am: I'm currently the CISO of a Fortune 500 company, and remain the co-founder of a competitive hacking group (CTF competitions).  I'm also a former trainer at TheLab... more generally, I'm a father, husband, hacker, and gamer (in that order) with a passion for information security and finding new ways of doing things.
>
>What I like to do: Right now I'm most heavily involved in firmware exploitation, playing with extraction and vulnerability enumeration, but my background comes from DoD space with software and OS exploitation, as well as electronics intelligence and RF simulation.
>
>Why me: I've been a member for several years, and participated where I can, but I'd like to see us take TheLab to a new place.  In particular, I'd like to introduce a little structure into things, like better power distribution to the teaching spaces, integrated help and procedures for tools, an in-house lab environment and CTF accessible to members via a separate network, etc.  This is what I often end up doing for the organizations I work for, and I'd love the opportunity to do the same for TheLab.


Kevin Horn - "khorn" - Nominee for Treasurer

>Howdy!  I'm Kevin.
>
>I'm interested in software, music, electronics, robotics, woodworking, metalworking, plastics, and a bunch of other ways to make things.
>
>Most recently I'm interested in making systems to make The Lab run more smoothly and more successfully.  I want to make it possible (and easy!) to answer questions which are currently difficult to answer about the state of The Lab's membership and finances.  I want to improve the visibility of our finances.  I want to bring more flexibility to the way we handle membership subscriptions.  And most of all, I want to help The Lab survive, grow, and thrive.
>
>At present, I feel I can do these things best as Treasurer of The Lab.  Please vote for me and help me help The Lab.
>
>Thanks!


Paul Ingendorf - "pauldy" - Nominee for Floating Board member and CTO

>A technologist of 30+ years with business and technical experience across the board in running small to medium sized companies and their networks.  I’ve done many startups and bootstrapped them all so I know how to work within the tightest of resources constraints for maximum results and thinking outside the box when the unexpected comes up.
>
>My motivation in running for the positions of CTO and Floating Board Member is to be able to put my technical expertise to work in the role of the CTO and my business expertise to work in the role of Floating Board Member serving the members and helping to directly influence the direction of TheLab.ms to put it on a steady growth path. I will make sure the resource requirements are met for TheLab.ms.  I will make sure the services provided by the lab are worthy of our members dues, this includes both the educational and maker services.  I'm committed to the positions I have been nominated to and will make efficient use of all the resources at my disposal to serve the membership and the needs of TheLab.ms.
>
>I look forward to serving all the members of the lab should you chose me this coming Saturday and over the next four months validating your confidence in me.
