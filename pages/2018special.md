The annual meeting in June is where our voting membership gets to elect our leadership, make changes to the bylaws, and raise issues for discussion.
This special meeting is being held to address several recent vacancies is the leadership team and will be held similar to an annual meeting.

### Date and Time and Location

### Voting

Voting is open to all voting members and you do not need to be present at the annual meeting to vote.

Any member may declare themselves a voting member by meeting the voting member requirements as laid out in our [Bylaws](https://thelab.ms/makers/Bylaws.html).  
Voting member requirements include among other things showing proof of identification via a goverment issued photo ID, valid contact information, and an agreement to have membership details be disclosed as required by law.

In order to declare yourself a voting member contact [vote@thelab.ms](mailto:vote@thelab.ms).

#### Proxy Voting

Voting will take place at the lab space either electronically or via paper ballot (method TBD).  If a voting member wishes to vote but cannot attend the meeting in person they can vote by proxy.  This will require an email be sent to secretart@thalab.ms to declare your intention to vote by proxy.  Instructions will be sent back on how to cast votes at that time (might be an online link or require an email, TBD)

### Current State of Leadership Team

Most of the current leadership team have resigned thier positions with two exceptions: Tommy Falgout as Floating Board Member (he was the last remaining board member), and James Ford as Facilities Coordinator.  These two positions will continue to be filled as normal until the end of thier normal term in June.

These resignations caused a bit of a crisis as our Bylaws could no longer provide for a way to fill the vacancies.  Fortunatley State Law has a provision for filling board vacancies in the event that Bylaws do no provide for this.  Using this provision Tommy Falgout, as the last remaining board member, made some temporary board appointments to allow for a special election to fill the vacancies per our Bylaws.  These temporary appointments will expire after this upcoming election.

Here is the current leadership team including these special appointments:

* President - Greg Miller (expires 2/10)
* Vice President: Olivia Snyder (expires 2/10)
* Secretary: Richard Gowen (expires 2/10)
* Floating Board Member: Paul Ingendorf (expires 2/10)
* Floating Board Member: Tommy Falgout
* Facilities Coordinator - James Ford
* Chief Technology Officer - WhiskeyNeon
* Education Coordinator - Vacant
* Treasurer - Vacant
* Fundraising Coordinator - Vacant
* Cheif Legal Officer - Vacant

### Election of Leadership Team
